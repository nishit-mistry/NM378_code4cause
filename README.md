## Cropifier - Interacting with crops through a new eye
Cropifier is a AI based mobile application developed to identify crop using only field photo of a crop. The application allows the user to take photos and automatically identify the crop. The photo and crop information along with Geo-location information is stored in an internal database which can be exported/emailed. Cropifier is aimed at people especially data collection officials for identifying an important variety of the crops on the field and off the field as well.

## **Deep Learning Architectures used:**
The process of Data augmentation has been done. for that we have included grey scale image of crop to achieve greater accuracy at training and testing phase.

**Inception Model:** Inception has Ability to factorize large convolution and use wider network rather than deeper network. Inception V3 uses RMSprop Optimizer. It takes and factorize 7x7 convolution which is larger than 5x5 conv for v2.

**SSD MobileNet Model:** Depth wise separable convolution is used to reduce model size and complexity. SSD MobileNet takes only one single shot to dtect multiple object within a single image if present.

**Emsemble Learning:** Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the accuracy, prediction and function approximation. 

Consider a scenario, in which you are the director of a film and you want to know the audience review. What will you do?

A. Ask a friend of yours to review it

B. Ask 5 friends for feedback

C. Ask 50 people to give the rating

Now the results can be generated by voting or averaging the feedbacks of A,B and C. This result provides an higher acuuracy percentage. This is an example of emsemble learning.
