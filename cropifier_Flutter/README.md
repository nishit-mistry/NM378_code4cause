## Cropifier - Interacting with crops through a new eye
Cropifier is a AI based mobile application developed to identify crop using only field photo of a crop. The application allows the user to take photos and automatically identify the crop. The photo and crop information along with Geo-location information is stored in an internal database which can be exported/emailed. Cropifier is aimed at people especially data collection officials for identifying an important variety of the crops on the field and off the field as well. 

## **Features**

1. **User Friendly Interface** - Minimal and simple user interface with which user can get easily acquainted.

2. **Crop Identification** - Choose from Gallery and get the result within seconds along with great accuracy.

3. **Crop Information** - Get the details about the identified crop in  a very precise manner gathered from various government and non-government sources.

4. **Real-Time Identification** - Livefeed option can be used to directly identify crops in real-time without even clicking image of the crop.

5. **Crop Map** - Explore the crops grown in India. 

6. **Crop Information Sharing** - Save crop information file in all 4 different langauges and share with anyone,anywhere.

7. **Offline Access to Crop Information** - Get information about multiple crops without Crops with Internet.

8. **Cross Platform Compatibility** - Available in both Android and iOS devices.

## **Deep Learning Architectures used:**
The process of Data augmentation has been done. for that we have included grey scale image of crop to achieve greater accuracy at training and testing phase.

**Emsemble Learning:** Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the accuracy, prediction and function approximation.

Consider a scenario, in which you are the director of a film and you want to know the audience review. What will you do?

A. Ask a friend of yours to review it

B. Ask 5 friends for feedback

C. Ask 50 people to give the rating

Now the results can be generated by voting or averaging the feedbacks of A,B and C. This result provides an higher acuuracy percentage. This is an example photos we took and tested on our ensemble model and achieved some great results. We have implemented the Emsembled model of MobileNet and two layer neural network.
